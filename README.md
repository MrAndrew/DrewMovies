# DrewMovies

Stage 1 implementation of a popular movies app, a requirement for fullfilling the Udacity NanoDegree program. This is an Android project
created from scratch following guidelines and instuctions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true#h.cntdg23jy69n).

## Getting Started

If you want to see the application in action, clone or download the project and unzip it to your desired folder location. Open the project in Android Studio and build. 

Note: Android Studio may ask you to update certain dependencies. This is not reccomended as the project hasn't been tested using other configurations. Ignore these updates and run in an emulator with an Android APK level declared in the app folder's build.gradle file.
